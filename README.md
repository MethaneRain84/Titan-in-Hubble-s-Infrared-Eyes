# Titan-in-Hubbles-Infrared-Eyes
#### This was a project I worked on as an intern at Southwest Researh Institue (SwRI) as a senior at the University of Colorado. Unfortunately I didn't go as far as I wanted with this project. 

#### This was the first time I really got into a coding project and on top of that I needed to not only blend in with the group but also needed to understand the portion of the overall project.

#### The purpose of the group at SwRI was to use Python to try and simulate Titan's atmosphere through use of Monte Carlo reduction, through Markov Chains, and optcial depth equations. However, the objective can't be reasonable unless we know how the actual atmosphere behaves. This is where my project came in. I was tasked with the opportunity to work with Hubble Telescope data to produce images of Titan in infrared wavelengths, since methane's absorption bands are mostly in the infrared. 

#### The majority of my work was based on understanding and retreiving data in file formats unfimiliar to me. The data was compressed in the pipeline as .fits extensions. The data was really 3 dimensions compressed into a 2 dimensional data format. 

#### There was a lot that I took away from this opportunity. I had a wondeful and up close experience working in an academic group at the professional level. I learned what it was to be working on a particular piece of a greater whole, which means the desire for good communication and level of competence.
