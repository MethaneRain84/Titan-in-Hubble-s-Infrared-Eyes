# Titan-in-Hubbles-Infrared-Eyes
### This was a project I worked on as an intern at Southwest Researh Institue (SwRI) as a senior at the University of Colorado. Unfortunately I didn't go as far as I wanted with this project. 
### This was the first time I really got into a coding project and on top of that I needed to not only blwnd in with the group but also needed to understand the portion of the overall project.
